# Weekend Movies Saga


## Description

This project is going to be a test in using Sagas, React, and redux to build a movie list of available movies for movie night. To that end we're going to store all of the posters we have available and display that as a list. When the individual item is clicked on the movie description will display.

Users will be able to view these options and then click on the button to return to the movie list.
